# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 15/21 | Overall this is a good website from a user's perspective. There are parts that seem tedious to the user and could take some small adjustments but overall I was pleased with how it went.|
| Monster.com | 12/21 | This is a decent website for the average user, but there are multiple pieces I would fix if I was a developer. |

## 2.2 Site 1 - LinkedIn

I have already set up my account on this website, so there are no screenshots of that process.
| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  2 | Not much thinking was required. The steps that were necessary were straight forward and easy to complete.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  1 | There always seemed to be more to do and that I was never truly finished with my profile. This could be a good thing since the website is going farther to expand my network, but did not show me how long until I was done.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  |  All of the important pieces were separated easily from the less important. Areas such as work experience, volunteering, skills, etc were all suggested the user fill out. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |   3  | There is definitely a science behind the website and what they see as beneficial to the user and the businesses. The website takes in this information and puts the user on a specificed path to make their chances of getting hired greater.   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2 | The site did not copy many words.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  |  There was a progress bar when setting up an account and completing applications. However, as I mentioned previously, the "extra stuff" seemed to go on forever. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | The mobile application of this website is amazing.  |
| **TOTAL** |  15 | Overall, a good site.  |

## 2.3 Site 2

Adding information about myself and my work experience felt organized.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  2 | Not much thinking was required. The steps that were necessary were straight forward and easy to complete.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 |  More work was completed in less time that LinkedIn. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | Clear and definite areas to put specific work/education/etc.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1  | Seemed to be going in loops.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 1  | Goes along with going in loops,   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  1 | No progress bar to measure how much longer I would be working.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1  | Not great, but not terrible.  |
| **TOTAL** | 12  | Overall a decent website from a user's perspective. There are some obvious pieces that need to be changed, but to the average person, it is sufficient.  |
